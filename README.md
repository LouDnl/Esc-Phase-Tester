Solder wires to the A B & C pads and solder these wires directly onto the ESC output pads.\
Make sure you have a motor attached to the ESC aswell.\
Spin the motor with your favorite software or servo tester and see the magic.\

With tips and help with the PCB design from A. Fedorov.\
Based on [Miha Vuk](https://youtu.be/itS592cHuSg) his idea for testing an esc with 3 light bulbs.
